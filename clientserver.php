	 <p>by Mohammed Alshmayri</p>
	 
	 <h2>What is the Client Server Model?</h2>
	 
	 <p>The client/server computing model, or architecture, 
	 is a computer/software/network model in which some computers
	 or software act as "clients" that make "requests" for a data 
	 or a service and other computers or software act as "servers"
	 that listen for and respond to these requests. For example,a 
	 web client (e.g. a computer running the Chrome browser) makes
	 requests for web pages from a web server (another computer running
	 a web server software such as Apache).</p>
	 
	 <h2>Advantages of the client server model</h2>
	 
	 <p>Several major advantages of the client server model are:</p>
	 
	 <ol>
		<li>Centralized storage</li>
		<li>Centralized security</li>
		<li>Backup and recovery</li>
		<li>Scalable</li>
	 </ol>

		<h2>Examples of TCP/IP Prrotocols</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>HTTP - web pages</li>
			<li>HTTPS - secure web pages</li>
			<li>FTP - upload/download files</li>

		<h2>Example of Network Utilities and Services</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>ipconfig - utiltiy that is used to manage the IP address
			assigned to the machine it is running in (source: https://www.pcmag.com)</li>
			<li>tracert - utility that you can use to trace the path that
			an Internet Protocol (IP) packet takes to its destination. (source: https://microsoft.com)</li>
			<li>ping - utility, available on virtually any operating system
			with network connectivity, that acts as a test to see if a 
			networked device is reachable. (source: https://www.paessler.com)</li>
			<li>pathping - utility allowing the user to reveal the path between two hosts. (source: https://www.techopedia.com)
			<li><a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/">whois</a> 
			- a widely used Internet record listing that identifies who owns a domain and how to get in contact with them (source: www.domaintools.com)</li>
